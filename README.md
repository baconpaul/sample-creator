Nothing to see here.

Steps to MVP

UI
    - log messages onto display

Code in Engine:
    - gate time
    - release detection
    - velocity ranges coded
    - Round robins coded

then ship to Omri (and maybe Andreya and Jacky also)

Then:

- Pick a format ui but do nothing now/ sfz/multisampe etc
- poly rendering perhaps
- Mod tinywav to also have an `inst` block
- threading in process loop
