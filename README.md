Nothing to see here.

Big swaths of work until there is though

- Format Support
    - Do we want to store or write other sample metadata?

- UI
    - Light skin doesn't suck (and is objeyed in step() in the Skin)
  
    - Scroll bar on the log would be nice eh
    - An actual design! Lets hope Steve bites :)
    - Range and Latency and so on controls freeze while rendering

- Engine / Rendering
    - "Drone Mode" - what is it and how would it work?. I like the idea of cut in
      half and add fades but controlling that is tricky
    - Loop Points - should we do something?
    - Implement polyphonic rendering
    - SFZ won't load in tal sampler. Why?


- Future Things
    - Decent Sampler could have a UI and Effects by default?
