A minimal C library for reading and writing (32-bit float or 16-bit int) WAV audio files. Designed for maximum portability.

* TinyWav takes and provides audio samples in configurable channel formats (interleaved, split, inline). WAV files always store samples in interleaved format.
* TinyWav is minimal: it can only read/write RIFF WAV files with sample format `float32` or `int16`.
* TinyWav does not allocate any memory on the heap. It uses `alloca` internally, which allocates on the stack. In practice, this restricts the block size to "reasonable" values, so watch out for stack overflows.

**CI/CD**: To guarantee portability, TinyWav is built and tested on several platforms, compilers & architectures:

## Code Example
### Writing

```c
#include "tinywav.h"

#define NUM_CHANNELS 2
#define SAMPLE_RATE 48000
#define BLOCK_SIZE 480

TinyWav tw;
tinywav_open_write(&tw,
    NUM_CHANNELS,
    SAMPLE_RATE,
    TW_FLOAT32, // the output samples will be 32-bit floats. TW_INT16 is also supported
    TW_INLINE,  // the samples to be written will be assumed to be inlined in a single buffer.
                // Other options include TW_INTERLEAVED and TW_SPLIT
    "path/to/output.wav" // the output path
);

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  // NOTE: samples are always expected in float32 format, 
  // regardless of file sample format

  float samples[BLOCK_SIZE * NUM_CHANNELS];
  tinywav_write_f(&tw, samples, BLOCK_SIZE);
  
  ...
}

tinywav_close_write(&tw);
```

### Reading
```c
#include "tinywav.h"

#define NUM_CHANNELS 2
#define SAMPLE_RATE 48000
#define BLOCK_SIZE 480

TinyWav tw;
tinywav_open_read(&tw, 
	"path/to/input.wav",
	TW_SPLIT // the samples will be delivered by the read function in split format
);

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  // samples are always provided in float32 format, 
  // regardless of file sample format
  float samples[NUM_CHANNELS * BLOCK_SIZE];
  
  // Split buffer requires pointers to channel buffers
  float* samplePtrs[NUM_CHANNELS];
  for (int j = 0; j < NUM_CHANNELS; ++j) {
    samplePtrs[j] = samples + j*BLOCK_SIZE;
  }

  tinywav_read_f(&tw, samplePtrs, BLOCK_SIZE);
  
  ...
}

tinywav_close_read(&tw);
```

##Â Running the Tests

TinyWav relies on Cmake for its test builds. The automated tests are based on the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) C++ test framework.

To run the tests, run one of the generator scripts in the `test/scripts` directory to generate a Xcode/VS project - or directly use Cmake in the commandline:

```bash
mkdir -p test/scripts/build
cd test/scripts/build
cmake ../../..
make
ctest # or run ./TinyWavTest directly
```

> **NOTE**: The Git repository uses Git LFS to store some reference wav files as binaries. Make sure you have Git LFS installed/enabled/pulled before running the tests.
